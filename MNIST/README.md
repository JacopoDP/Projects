#MNIST

As a first project i'll train a bunch of classifiers over a MNIST dataset to get a model that can detect handwritten digits.
The first step is to train classic classifiers as linear, SVM, decisionTree, random Forest, KNN then try to use them to build a more refined one using voting and stacking tecniques.
